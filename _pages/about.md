Welcome! I'm Zehan Zhao, a fervent explorer at the intersection of artificial intelligence, robotics, and medical science. My academic voyage began at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where I immersed myself in computer science, navigating its vast intricacies and challenges. My thirst for knowledge led me to New York University (NYU), where I expanded my horizon with a master's degree, delving deeply into machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL).

Currently, my research focuses on biology data augmentation. I'm genuinely passionate about pushing the boundaries in bioinformatics. I see a future where AI simplifies and unravels the complex layers of biological data, making what once seemed impossible, possible.

But my journey hasnâ€™t been confined to just the classroom and the research lab. I've been fortunate enough to wear multiple hats in the tech industry. As a Software Development Engineer (SDE) intern, I honed my coding prowess with Java, building robust and efficient solutions for real-world challenges. Venturing further into the realm of artificial intelligence, I embraced the role of a Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) intern, where I zeroed in on object detection.
